# Analysis of District Spending and Test Scores

We began our analysis with a look into some of the school district’s key metrics, and developed a number of tables showing the top and bottom 5 performing schools based on passing rate, the average math and reading scores in each grade at each school, and school performance based on budget, size and type.
